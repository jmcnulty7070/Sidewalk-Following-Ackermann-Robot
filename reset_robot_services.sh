#!/usr/bin/env bash
# reset_robot_services.sh
# Purpose: Cleanly stop any running SegMAV / MAVROS / MAVLink Router / LDLiDAR processes
# and disable their systemd services so you can run everything manually.
# Usage:
#   chmod +x reset_robot_services.sh
#   ./reset_robot_services.sh
#
# Notes:
# - This script uses sudo for systemctl operations.
# - Nonexistent services or processes won't cause the script to fail.
# - After it finishes, it will print any services still enabled on the system.
