This guide shows how to use the **QuickTune Lua script** with an **Ackermann-style rover** (front steering vehicle), such as one using a **Radiolink CrossFlight** flight controller.

## ‚úÖ Why It Works for Ackermann

- ArduPilot Rover supports Ackermann steering (set `FRAME_TYPE = 2`)
- QuickTune auto-tunes:
  - Steering controller
  - Speed/throttle controller
- Works even with Ackermann-style vehicles (no skid or differential turning required)

## üîß Installation Steps

1. Flash **Rover firmware** to your CrossFlight via Mission Planner.
2. Enable scripting:
   - `SCR_ENABLE = 1`
3. Copy the `rover-quicktune.lua` script to your SD card:
   ```
   /APM/scripts/rover-quicktune.lua
   ```
4. Reboot your autopilot.
5. In Mission Planner:
   - Set `RC9_OPTION = 300` (or any unused RC channel)
6. Ensure vehicle can drive in a smooth circle in **CIRCLE mode**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running QuickTune

1. Set flight mode to `CIRCLE`
2. Drive in a smooth circle manually.
3. Flip the RC switch:
   - **Middle** = Do nothing
   - **High** = Start tuning
   - **Low** = Cancel tuning
4. After a few rotations, the script:
   - Tunes **steering controller**
   - Tunes **speed controller**
5. Flip the switch to HIGH again to **save the gains**

## üìå Tips

- Make sure your **steering and throttle respond smoothly** before tuning.
- Keep the **circle radius reasonably wide** for Ackermann.
- You can later fine-tune gains:
  - `ATC_STR_RAT_P`, `ATC_STR_RAT_I`, etc.
- You can plot results in Mission Planner logs or view them live in the **tuning window**.

## üìÅ Optional: Include in GitHub Project

- Add this guide as `README_QuikTune.md`
- Include the Lua script in your repo `/scripts`
